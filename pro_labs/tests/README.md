# Tests
### test files should ends with `.t.cpp` or `.t.c`
Because im too lazy to link it with GTest, every test should be placed inside its <br>
coresponding directory (its just a recommendation, you can do whatever you want with it ;] ).
Also tests dont provide any printf and in test fail case, test file should be manually checked
